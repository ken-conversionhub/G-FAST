### Creating your separate CSS file and importing it to the base Sass file

This site uses Sass to make our stylesheets more organised. The base code of our styles is located in ```sass/style.sass``` which compiles to ```css/style.css```, so it is highly recommended to avoid manually updating the CSS files and instead write your CSS in the Sass files.
